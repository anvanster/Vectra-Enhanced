# Vectra Performance Optimization TODO

## Overview
This document outlines future performance optimizations for Vectra to handle large-scale operations efficiently. The current implementation is solid and ready for pre-release testing, supporting datasets up to ~1M vectors with good performance.

## Performance Optimizations for Large-Scale Operations

### 1. Batch Operations
- **Batch Insert API**: Implement `insertItems()` method that processes multiple items in a single transaction
  - Reduce file I/O overhead by batching metadata file writes
  - Optimize HNSW index updates for batch insertions
  - Single WAL entry for entire batch
  ```typescript
  await index.insertItems([
    { id: '1', vector: [...], metadata: {...} },
    { id: '2', vector: [...], metadata: {...} },
    // ... up to 1000 items
  ]);
  ```

- **Batch Update/Delete**: Similar optimizations for bulk updates and deletions
- **Configurable batch sizes** based on available memory

### 2. Parallel Processing
- **Worker Threads for CPU-intensive operations**:
  - Vector similarity calculations
  - Checksum computation for large files
  - HNSW index building
  ```typescript
  // Example: Parallel HNSW build
  const workers = new WorkerPool(os.cpus().length);
  await workers.buildHNSWIndex(items);
  ```

- **Parallel file I/O** for metadata operations
- **Concurrent query processing** with result merging

### 3. Memory-Mapped Files
- **mmap support for large indices**:
  - Direct memory access without loading entire index
  - Shared memory between processes
  - OS-level caching benefits
  ```typescript
  const index = new LocalIndex(path, {
    useMmap: true,
    mmapThreshold: 100_000 // Use mmap for indices > 100k items
  });
  ```

- **Partial index loading** based on access patterns
- **Memory pressure handling** with automatic unmapping

### 4. Enhanced Streaming APIs
- **Streaming query results**:
  ```typescript
  const stream = index.queryStream(vector, { 
    batchSize: 100,
    maxResults: 10000 
  });
  
  for await (const batch of stream) {
    // Process results in chunks
  }
  ```

- **Streaming inserts** with backpressure handling
- **Progressive index building** for very large datasets

### 5. Index Sharding
- **Automatic sharding** based on index size:
  ```typescript
  const index = new ShardedIndex(path, {
    maxItemsPerShard: 1_000_000,
    shardingStrategy: 'hash' // or 'range'
  });
  ```

- **Distributed queries** across shards
- **Dynamic shard rebalancing**
- **Shard-level locking** for better concurrency

### 6. Query Optimizations
- **Query result caching**:
  - LRU cache for frequent queries
  - Invalidation on updates
  - Configurable cache size

- **Approximate algorithms** for faster results:
  - LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing) for pre-filtering
  - Product quantization for memory reduction
  - Configurable accuracy/speed tradeoffs

- **Query planning** for complex filters:
  - Index statistics for optimal execution
  - Filter pushdown to HNSW search
  - Early termination for top-k queries

### 7. Storage Optimizations
- **Compression**:
  - Vector quantization (8-bit, 4-bit)
  - Metadata compression with dictionary encoding
  - Transparent compression/decompression

- **Tiered storage**:
  - Hot/cold data separation
  - Archival to object storage
  - Lazy loading from cold storage

- **Delta encoding** for incremental updates
- **Copy-on-write** for snapshot efficiency

### 8. Monitoring and Profiling
- **Performance metrics**:
  ```typescript
  const metrics = await index.getPerformanceMetrics();
  // {
  //   queryLatencyP99: 12.5,
  //   insertThroughput: 10000,
  //   indexSize: 1234567890,
  //   cacheHitRate: 0.95
  // }
  ```

- **Query profiling** with execution plans
- **Resource usage tracking**
- **Automatic performance tuning**

### 9. Network and Distributed Features
- **Client/Server mode**:
  - gRPC or HTTP API
  - Connection pooling
  - Request batching

- **Replication support**:
  - Master-slave replication
  - Eventual consistency
  - Conflict resolution

- **Federated search** across multiple indices

### 10. Language-Specific Optimizations
- **SIMD instructions** for vector operations
- **Native addons** for performance-critical paths
- **GPU acceleration** for similarity calculations
- **WebAssembly** for browser environments

## Performance Benchmarks to Add

### Benchmark Suite
```typescript
// benchmarks/performance.ts
import { LocalIndex } from 'vectra';

describe('Performance Benchmarks', () => {
  benchmark('Insert Performance', {
    sizes: [1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000],
    dimensions: [128, 512, 1536],
    scenarios: ['sequential', 'batch', 'concurrent']
  });

  benchmark('Query Performance', {
    indexSizes: [10000, 100000, 1000000],
    topK: [10, 100, 1000],
    filters: ['none', 'simple', 'complex']
  });

  benchmark('Memory Usage', {
    operations: ['load', 'insert', 'query', 'compact'],
    trackMetrics: ['heap', 'rss', 'external']
  });
});
```

### Metrics to Track
- Insert throughput (items/second)
- Query latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Memory usage (MB per 1K items)
- Disk I/O (reads/writes per operation)
- CPU utilization
- Lock contention rate

## API Design Considerations

### Backward Compatibility
```typescript
// Current API remains unchanged
await index.insertItem({ ... });

// New batch API is additive
await index.insertItems([{ ... }, { ... }]);

// Progressive enhancement through options
const index = new LocalIndex(path, {
  performance: {
    enableBatching: true,
    cacheSize: '1GB',
    useWorkers: true
  }
});
```

### Configuration Best Practices
```typescript
// performance.config.js
export default {
  small: {  // < 100K items
    batchSize: 100,
    cacheSize: '100MB',
    workers: 0
  },
  medium: { // 100K - 1M items
    batchSize: 1000,
    cacheSize: '1GB',
    workers: 2
  },
  large: {  // > 1M items
    batchSize: 10000,
    cacheSize: '4GB',
    workers: 4,
    enableSharding: true
  }
};
```
